# CHANGES.md

This file list a number of new features as well as some changes i want to make to this project.


### Goal

This new version of the application will encompass and end to end solution for my 3D printing business
At a high level my goal is to create a new invoicing application similar to Invoice Ninja that will send
newly invoiced products to the "wizqueue" for production.

The current status of "wizqueue" reads a digital PDF copy of the invoice to create the queue.

I would like to fully plan the development and the changes to the to current queue app before coding.

Here is a short list of features/changes I have already though of:
1. there is no way to add a single item to the queue and there should be
2. there should be a favicon to complete the branding
3. there should be a way to mark queue items as partially complete where there is a qty greater than 1 for that item
4. there should be a way to manually change the queue item qty
5. i want to match the branding (color, look, feel, buttons, everything) from the previous project we did for the wiz3d prints web site (~/wiz3d_prints)
6. on the upload screen there is no way to navigate back to the main screen, this may be a moot point if the queue process changes with the invoicing
